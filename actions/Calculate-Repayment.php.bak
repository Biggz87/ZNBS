 * @param double $interest        The interest rate for the loan.
 * @param int    $num_of_payments The total number of payments for the loan in months.
 * @param double $PV              The present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now;
 *                                Also known as the principal.
 * @param double $FV              The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made.
 *                                If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.
 * @param int    $Type            Optional, defaults to 0. The number 0 (zero) or 1 and indicates when payments are due.
